            <h1>Why this Project</h1>
            <p>We choose to do this project because in today's market there are many
                websites that recommend restaurants, but they do not have the options to see
                if there are nearby parking spaces in the area, the number of reserved tables
                for that evening and the random selection. In our opinion, these are important
                things for choosing a restaurant, so we focused on them when we created the
                system.</p>

            <h1>What was done?</h1>
            <p>In our website focused on 2 main functions for restaurant
                selection:
                1.Random selection - The user gets 3 questions and
                according the
                answers the system will automatically find the best
                restaurant for him.
                2.Regular selection - The user provides name of city and
                after that he will get a list of restaurants. He can choose one
                of them and get information about it.</p>
