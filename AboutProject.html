        <div class="titleDiv">
        <p id="title">
            
            We choose to do this project because in today's market there are many
            websites that recommend restaurants, but they do not have the options to see
            if there are nearby parking spaces in the area, the number of reserved tables
            for that evening and the random selection. In our opinion, these are important
            things for choosing a restaurant, so we focused on them when we created the
            system.

    <div class="titleDiv2">
        <p id="title2">
            In our website focused on 2 main functions for restaurant
            selection:
            <br>
            
            1.Random selection - The user gets 3 questions and
            according the
            answers the system will automatically find the best
            restaurant for him.

            <br>

            2.Regular selection - The user provides name of city and
            after that he will get a list of restaurants. He can choose one
            of them and get information about it.
